# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders is an arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado. I created a version of space invaders with C# with the help of Derek Banas Youtube tutorials "How to make video games" using Unity software.

EDIT: only uploaded the C# code for the game. it is missing the sounds and sprites.
